# Internship-Project
Here I did a Project on GNN to predict the link between and user and events.
"mtags&event&tags" file has dictionaries, of users and events, which is actually feature vectors. Here for users' feature dimension is 125997*1001 and for event's feature dimension is 115571*1548.
"Json_read" has the feature vectors of users and events. Here I used PCA and reduced the dimensions to 125997*500 and 115571*500.
"New_GNN" file has the model where I create the adjacency list and create a general graph structure and predict the link between the edges and users.
